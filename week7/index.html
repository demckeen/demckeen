                    Here are some little snippets about things I felt seemed useful in the reading that I hope to
                    remember:
                <ul>
                    <li>call() - to set “this” within a function, parameters can be passed after the first value (which
                        is always this), functions that don’t refer to a “this” can use call() but you pass “null” for
                        the “this” value as a first parameter. (apply is the same but arguments can be passed as array)
                    </li>
                    <li>Place entire function inside parentheses to call it immediately - anonymous no name function
                    </li>
                    <li>Temporary Variables - “Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will
                        ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. The example that
                        follows uses an IIFE to swap the value of two global variables, a and b. This process requires
                        the use of a temporary variable, called temp, which only exists while the IIFE is invoked:”
                        Use an IIFE (anonymous self-invoking function) to initialize conditions for code</li>
                    <li>Redefined functions lose properties previously set</li>
                    <li>Closure - A function within a function can have access to variables declared by it's parent
                        function
                        including making changes to those variables.
                    </li>
                    <li>Functional programming - using functions that are pure code to be as versatile as possible</li>
                    <li>AJAX - Javascript that can communicate with outside sources/servers
                        Have used in the past with API and JSON.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class='moreThoughts'>
                <p>Diving back into the Hikes Team Activity with the knowledge gained through working on
                    the ToDo List Challenge was really cool. I had a better understanding of some of the
                    structuring, but also with what we wanted it to do and how to accomplish our Local
                    Storage elements.
