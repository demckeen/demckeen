            <p>Working through the reading this week was a lot of review. I had a few 
                questions but then I accidentally started reading the first chapter after
                returning into another reading session and it actually answered the questions 
                I had like "JavaScript isn't Java?". Other reading answered some other 
                questions as well.
            </p>
            <p>There was one question I had that wasn't answered in the text, which was 
                "Can you adjust the location of the prompt and alert windows?" I did search
                for this answer and found that the answer is actually no, but I expect that
                if we continue through this Quiz Ninja book that we will continue to use
                other JavaScript techniques to create a better site experience.
            </p>
            <p>As it is, I did go ahead and add a button because I could not handle
                the quiz loading and popups happening immediately when there's a whole 
                graphic interface already created. We should at least get to look at that for a moment 
                before we continue with the quiz. As a side note, what a fun quiz.
