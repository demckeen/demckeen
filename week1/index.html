	<h1>Week One Notes</h1>
    <p>Working through the reading for this week, I was struck by how little the 
        PDF we were asked to read operated as expected. However, by relying upon
        my knowledge previously gained and making some logical leaps I was able to
        download the example files from the github directory and proceed to reviewing
        examples.
    </p>
    <p>Working through the initial examples of coding a button was a good warmup to
        remind me of working with code again after a bit of a break this summer. I also
        did not use much Javascript in my previous semester, so it was nice to have a 
        refresher in that sense as well. The Local Storage section made sense as to how 
        I was to make it function and it worked as expected, however I didn't understand
        what localStorage actually is. I did a little googling and think I have a 
        concept, that it is information stored in your browser profile.
    </p>
    <p>Next came the challenge of creating a js loop to load a list of links showing
        content for these various weeks of notes and challenges. I'm not sure if I have
        organized it in the way expected for the course, but I did not want to use
        an ordered list so I went with an unordered list instead, and making a link for each
        piece of content seems like a decent way to go.  The example however showed
        a mini landing page for the week with note content. Is this a better approach?
    </p>
    <p>Watching the Mobile First UX course was mostly review, but I did find the 
        section regarding mobile advertising to be extremely interesting. I know I am often 
        frustrated when trying to scroll through some article and ads are so huge I have 
        very little room for error when swiping to scroll. It's like swiping through an
        advertising minefield. I love the suggestion of smaller ads that can expand, or having 
        the ad appear through gaps in the content as a fixed element we get peeks of 
        throughout. Very cool and great ways of solving major pain points for mobile 
        users - which as we have seen in this course, are truly the primary market.
