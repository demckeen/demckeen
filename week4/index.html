            <p>
                I really like reading about objects and classes this way. I was feeling a bit of deja vu until I 
                realized I was reading this same type of content last week regarding PHP in my Web Backend Class. 
                Functionally they seem to be very similar - or rather conceptually I should say. I can tell that 
                this is yet another subject that I will need a lot of practice for it to sink in and become 
                something I can accomplish without continually referencing instructional material. I had fun 
                updating the Quiz Ninja to full fledged “got a ton of JSON” reality. I had to keep debugging, 
                though, because we weren’t asked to read every chapter so I started to add new Quiz Ninja stuff 
                that relied on things in previous chapters and then went back and tried to figure things out week 
                to week which was confusing. Still - I got it working and got to practice my debugging stills, 
                which was great.</a>.
            </p>
            <p>It was also fun working to solve the tic tac toe activity with my group. We have some fantastic 
                group members that really helped refine some of the clunky suggestions made by myself and those 
                of us who are less experienced with javascript. I wanted to find my own solutions to finishing the 
                game logic, though, so since we were already done with the main goals at one hour, we agreed to 
                move forward and continue to share any stretch goal solutions we came up with. I was so happy to have 
                something I could share back in return.</p>
