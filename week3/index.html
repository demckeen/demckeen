              The .hasOwnProperty() tool seems like it is potentially very useful. I 
              will have to see if there is some circumstance where it makes sense
              for me to use this in the future. I really like the examples of using
              objects as parameters for functions. It is very cool to be able to establish
              default parameters that can be overwritten while also even maintaining a parameter 
              that still must be defined. I also really liked seeing the explanation of 
              placing things within an object literal purely for use of the object as a 
              namespace. This is clearly something we see in major use in the <a href="

            <p>Playing around with event listeners is always a bit of fun as well. While 
              there are some things I definitely still don't have immediate encyclopedic grasp 
              of in terms of when I would write an implement a new scenario, running through
              several modifications was helpful in terms of concepts and knowing 
              what some of the possibilities are. I thought it was great to get the information
              about how touch interactions exist in this landscape. 
            </p>
            <p>This bit of information I definitely want to hang on to:</p>
            <p class="quote">“There are no 'swipe' events. These need to be created by using a combination of touchstart , touchmove , and touchleave events that monitor the distance and direction moved from start to finish of a touch event.
              If you need to implement gestures, it's probably a good idea to use a library such asHammer.JSorzingtouchthat makes events such as swipe, pinch and rotate easy to implement.”</p>
